# A test of the course setup

This repository is designed to help you work through the mode of working that you will do for this course. Please follow the steps below after you have your account set up on our department server using the install instructions for VS Code.

You should have already followed some instructions for cloning this repository in the VS Code editor and syncing a copy of it to the server.

**You should have the terminal open on the server and should have used the 'cd' command in the command line to be in the directory where this code is.**

# Hello, World

The file hello.c contains the classic basic C program. Let's start by compiling it and running it **on the server.**

## Compile it

In the terminal, type:

    gcc -o hello hello.c


## Run it

The following part of the compiler command above

    -o hello

indicates that an executable program file called hello will be created from your hello.c file.

To execute this executable file on the command line, type the following:

    ./hello

# Basic features of hello.c

The example program in the file `hello.c` has the basic components that all C programs have. Your programs should contain these parts at a minimum. We will add more complexity to our programs a bit later.

Let's look at the sections of this program, from top to bottom.

## 1. the includes at the top

Line 2 contains an include statement. These are used to indicate that we will use code from other libraries of C code. This signals to the compiler to find that library and load it during the *linking* stage of compilation.

### Info
Please see:
In chapter 1 of your course textbook, Figure 1.3 depicts the compilation process for a C program.


## 2. function declarations

Programs in C are decomposed into functions. Each function returns a value of some type, or returns nothing, in which case, as is shown on line 5, it returns void, as indicated before the function name itself.

Line 5, a **declaration**, is provided at the top of the file to indicate that there is a function called `aFunction` later in this file, and it returns void and takes one parameter of type int.

## 3. the main program

There must be one function called main that returns an int in all C programs. In this example, the main function has no parameters. We will see later that main can take specific parameter as command-line arguments.

## 4. function definitions

Beginning on line 17 is where we see the full **definition** of the function called `aFunction`.

### Info
Note that a **definition** is separate from a **declaration** and contains the complete function.

# Building code with make

C code compiling can be fairly complicated, especially when you have multiple code files that make up a project.

Unix systems provide a command-line program called `make`, when used in conjunction with a file that you write, usually named `Makefile`, will let you more easily build your C code into an executable.

Open the file called Makefile. It looks like this:

    CC = gcc                     #line 1
                                 #line 2
    hello: hello.c               #line 3
    	$(CC) -o hello hello.c   #line 4
	                             #line 5
    clean:                       #line 6
    	rm hello                 #line 7



There are some important things to know about makefiles. ...


- lines 4 and 7 are indented with a tab (for make, it MUST be a tab)

- $(CC) is replaced with what is to the right of the = in line 1
- comments begin with #

- the first line that has a word followed by a colon (in this case line 3) indicates the name of the executable that will get made from this makefile (in this case the program named `hello`).

- the file names after the colon on line 3 indicate what this executable depends on (in this case one hello.c file).

- the tabbed-in line 4 indicates how to compile and create the executable named `hello`.

### warning

One problem that often occurs when editing makefiles is to forget those pesky tab characters. If you get an error like this:

    Makefile:4: *** missing separator.  Stop.

It means that you used spaces instead of tabs.

## Try using make

Type these two alternatives at the command line:

    make

    make hello

Edit the hello.c file in VS Code on your laptop by changing this line in main (line 14) to print some  number other than 42:

    aFunction(42);

Next, **save the changes to hello.c**. To make sure the changes were synced on the server, go back to the terminal and try either command above again to re-compile it with make.

Do this:

    make clean
    ls

What did the make clean command do?

Then try making the code again.

Now you have the basics of the gcc compiler for C code and using make to handle the 'build' of your code. Next step:'turn it in'.

# Keep versions and Turn in assignments by saving changes to github

**IMPORTANT:** You should periodically do what we are going to describe here as you work on your homework. When you are at a point where code is working, it is always a good idea to *stage*, *commit*, and *push* it up to github, because:

- You will then have a version that you can always get back to when something goes wrong as you continue editing.

- If you need help from an instructor over email, they can see your code on github and help.

- If your laptop dies, there is a version on github that you can recover.


## From Visual Studio Code editor

From the far left, choose the tab along the left side that looks like 3 circles connect with lines.

Look for files under the section labeled Changes.

### 1. Stage the Changes
 You can stage each change individually by hovering over a file name and clicking the + icon. You can choose all files by hovering over the word Changes and slide to the right and pick the + icon.

 You can also stage all the changes to several files by choosing the menu with three dots, ..., and then 'Stage All Changes'.

 You should now see a new section called 'Staged Changes'.

### 2. Commit the changes

 Write in a commit message for these changes in the input line that says ''Message'. It helps to recover this commit if you give it a reasonable message.

 Choose the check mark icon to the right of hw0_hello-world to commit the changes.

### 3. Push the changes to github

 Then from the three dots menu to the right of hw0_hello-world, choose to 'Push'. You should see some activity in the lower left where the circular arrow icon is.

 ## Go to github.com to check for your changes

 Now in a web browser, log into your github.com account and find this repository and look for the changes that you made.

### Go back to the files display

The icon in the upper left that looks like files will take you to the view of the files in your cloned repository.
